Midas is a money management tool I built that catalogs and analyzes e-receipts from users' Gmail in a user-friendly dashboard. Its features are:
- Uses Google Sign In and OAuth 2.0 authorization for signing in and gaining permission to access a user's email
- Finds and extracts e-receipts to display them in a sortable table.
- Extracts data from the e-receipts and graphs the expenditures by days, weeks or months.
- Allows users to set budgets

**Technologies**: PHP, HTML/CSS/Javascript
