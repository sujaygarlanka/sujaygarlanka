# Open To Work

I am a Robotics Software Engineer with a Masters degree in computer science (robotics). During my graduate studies, I worked at [Stanford Vision Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/) developing action primitives (pick, place, navigate, etc.) on NVIDIA's Omniverse simulation environment using both algorithmic and distributed RL approaches. 
My worked focused on both engineering for speed via implementing fast collision detection for algorithmic primitives and parallelizable/distributed environments for RL training as well as for the efficacy of the primitives. 
Previously, I worked 3 years as a Software Engineer at [Box](https://www.box.com/) working on large scale data processing,
developing APIs and building heavily
used open source libraries for developers to interact with those APIs. On the side, I like tinkering
with hardware and software to build
interesting things.
